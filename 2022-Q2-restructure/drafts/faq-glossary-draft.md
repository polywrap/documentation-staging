- What is the difference between WASM and AssemblyScript?

- How do you run this if there is no central server?

- How does the polywrap interact with wallets?

- How does the versioning system work ? 

- How can I deploy my wrapper?

- How can I pin my wrapper?

- Do I need to know Assemblyscript to use a wrapper?
> No, AssemblyScript is one of the languages used to build the wrappers. Once this wrapper is built and published, you only would require GraphQL for executing the queries as well as a language with a supported Polywrap Client. In the future you'll also be able to interact with wrappers through the Polywrap Hub, directly from the browser.

What is the polywrap virtual machine?

> The polywrap virtual machine is a runtime environment for executing decentralized applications (DApps) on the Polywrap network. The virtual machine is responsible for managing the execution of DApps, and providing a secure and reliable environment for them to run.

What is the polywrap compiler?

> The polywrap compiler is a tool that allows developers to compile their decentralized applications (DApps) into bytecode that can be executed by the polywrap virtual

What are URIs?
